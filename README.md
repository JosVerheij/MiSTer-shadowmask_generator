# TODO

- [ ] skip normalised if there are no gray pixels
- [ ] adjust normalisation based on color intensity (monochrome is way too bright currently)
- [ ] folder organisation based on brightness
- [ ] decouple folders (ie. mask directories) as much as possible
- [ ] automatically calculate 'accurate' filters based on dot pitch ratio (25" at Â±.27mm dot pitch i believe)
